## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

This a a beginner project for the Udacity Data Science Nanodegree programm. For this project I was interestested in using AirBnB data of Munich, Germany, from March 2019 to March 2020 to better understand:

1. Does the room type influence the price?
2. How's the interaction between price and location?
3. Are more and better reviewed listings pricier?
4. Can host specific data (e.g. superhost, response time, ...) influence the price?
5. Are there price variations during the year (e.g. Oktoberfest)?


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebook ("AirBnB.ipynb") available which includes all related work to the above mentioned questions. 

The additional file "myutil.py" includes some small untility functions used in the notebook.

The folder data/munich/ includes all necessary datasets.


## Results<a name="results"></a>
